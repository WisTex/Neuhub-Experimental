# Neuhub-Experimental
Some experiments with creating Neuhub themes. I play around with them here, and if I like them, I might include them in Neuhub.

If you want example code to play around with, feel free. But these are unsupported, and can radically change. They are experiments, after all.

The experiments that are a success will be moved to one of these repositories:

* Neuhub - https://github.com/WisTex/Neuhub
* Neuhub-in-the_Rough - https://github.com/WisTex/Neuhub-in-the-Rough
